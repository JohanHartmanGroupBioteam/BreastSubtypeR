\value{
Launches the interactive Shiny application. The app provides subtyping calls
and ROR scores, downloadable as text files.
}
\description{
Launches the \strong{iBreastSubtypeR} Shiny application, a graphical interface for the BreastSubtypeR package.

The app allows users to run intrinsic molecular subtyping of breast cancer
using both nearest-centroid (NC-based) and single-sample predictor (SSP-based)
methods. It standardizes input and output handling, providing a reproducible
framework compatible with downstream R/Bioconductor tools.
\subsection{Workflow}{

\strong{Step 1 – Data mapping}
\itemize{
\item Load input data from the current R session or upload expression, clinical,
and feature annotation files (CSV/text format).
\item Run the \code{Mapping()} step by clicking \emph{Map Now}. Once complete, a message
confirms: \emph{"You may now proceed to Step 2."}
}

\strong{Step 2 – Subtyping analysis}
\itemize{
\item Select one or more subtyping methods (including \code{AUTO}) and configure
parameters.
\item Run the analysis. Upon completion, a message confirms: \emph{"Analysis is complete."}
\item Two diagnostic visualizations are displayed. Results can be downloaded as a
text file. Users may re-run other methods directly without repeating Step 1.
}
}

\subsection{Notes}{
\itemize{
\item See \code{?BS_Multi} and \code{?Mapping} for detailed parameter descriptions.
\item iBreastSubtypeR is intended for local use; no data are uploaded externally.
