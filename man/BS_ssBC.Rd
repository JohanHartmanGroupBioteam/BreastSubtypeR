\title{ssBC Intrinsic Subtyping (BS_ssBC)}
\usage{
BS_ssBC(
  gene_expression_matrix,
  phenodata,
  s,
  Subtype = FALSE,
  hasClinical = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_expression_matrix}{A gene expression matrix with genes in rows and samples in columns. The data should be log-transformed.}

\item{phenodata}{A clinical information table. The first column must contain sample or patient names, named \code{"PatientID"}.
\itemize{
\item When \code{"s"} is set as \code{"ER"}, the table must include an \code{"ER"} column, where estrogen receptor (ER) status is recorded as \code{"ER+"} or \code{"ER-"}.
\item When \code{"s"} is set as \code{"ER.v2"}, the table must include an \code{"ER"} column, where estrogen receptor (ER) status is recorded as \code{"ER+"} or \code{"ER-"}, and a \code{"HER2"} column, where human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is recorded as \code{"HER2+"} or \code{"HER2-"}.
\item When \code{"s"} is set as \code{"TN"} or \code{"TN.v2"}, the table must include a \code{"TN"} column, recording triple-negative samples as \code{"TN"}.
}}

\item{s}{Character. Options are \code{"ER"}, \code{"TN"}, \code{"ER.v2"}, or \code{"TN.v2"}. Specifies the quantiles to use:
\itemize{
\item \code{"ER"} and \code{"TN"}: Original quantiles published in \emph{Breast Cancer Research} (2015).
\item \code{"ER.v2"} and \code{"TN.v2"}: Updated quantiles published in \emph{Journal of Clinical Oncology} (2024).
}}

\item{Subtype}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the function predicts four subtypes by excluding the Normal-like subtype.}

\item{hasClinical}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the function uses clinical data from the \code{phenodata} table. Required columns include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"T"}: Tumor size.
\item \code{"NODE"}: Lymph node status.
}}
}
\value{
A vector of intrinsic subtypes assigned to the samples, as estimated by the ssBC method.
}
\description{
Performs intrinsic subtyping of breast cancer using the ssBC (single-sample Breast Cancer) method. This method allows for quantile selection tailored to specific breast cancer cohorts and published guidelines.
}
\examples{
## ssBC.v2
data("OSLO2EMIT0obj")
res = BS_ssBC(
  gene_expression_matrix = data_input$x_NC.log,
  phenodata = clinic.oslo,
  s = "ER.v2",
  Subtype = FALSE,
  hasClinical = FALSE
)
